# devbench-cli.sh -- talk to a RUNNING Skyrim via alandtse's DevBench SKSE plugin.
#
# DevBench (Nexus SE 181326) runs a localhost REST+MCP server inside the live game, so Codex can
# inspect state, run console commands AND READ THEIR OUTPUT, call Papyrus functions, and drive
# scripted scenarios -- instead of you hand-testing and reporting back.
#
# NOT bundled: install DevBench yourself from Nexus (GPL-3.0). This wrapper just drives its REST API.
#
# The game must be RUNNING with a save loaded. When it isn't, the port is dead and every call here
# fails fast with a clear message -- fall back to the offline tools (xelib/Spriggit/ReSaver).
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh ping                       # server self-test (NOT proof of liveness)
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh alive                      # is the GAME running / paused / hung?
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh health                     # raw off-thread liveness+identity probe
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh state                      # {plugin,version,vr,playerLoaded,frame}
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh inspect vm                 # kinds: state health vm scene mods player
#                                                         #        inventory quests effects refs
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh exec "player.getav health" # console exec + capture + read output
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh call Utility GetCurrentGameTime
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh call Actor IsInCombat '[]' '{"form":"0x14"}'
#   bash tools/devbench-cli.sh tool menu '{"action":"accept"}'   # raw escape hatch: any tool, any JSON
