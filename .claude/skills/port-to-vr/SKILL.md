description: Walk a seven-step checklist for porting an SSE-only mod to Skyrim VR, covering SKSE dependencies, Papyrus script audit, skeleton compatibility, physics and combat, UI and menus, the animation system, and ESP record checks. Use when the user wants to port a mod to VR, asks whether an SSE mod works in VR, or is debugging a mod that misbehaves only in VR.

# Port SSE Mod to VR

Systematically check the mod specified by `$ARGUMENTS` against every known VR incompatibility. Consult `KNOWLEDGEBASE.md` for full details on each item.

## Step 1: SKSE Dependency Check

- Does the mod require SKSE64? → Needs SKSEVR equivalent
- Check for address library dependencies → VR address library is entirely different
- Look for DLL plugins in `Data/SKSE/Plugins/` → must be compiled against SKSEVR
- Check if CommonLibSSE-NG versions exist (supports SE + AE + VR in one build)

## Step 2: Papyrus Script Audit

Decompile all `.pex` files and check for:
- [ ] `PlayIdle()` on player → fails in VR (VRIK overrides skeleton IK). Replace with timed Papyrus scripts.
- [ ] `DisablePlayerControls()` alone → doesn't stop VR thumbstick movement. Add `SetDontMove(true)`.
- [ ] `SetVehicle()` → causes HMD desync in VR. Must be removed entirely.
- [ ] `ForceThirdPerson()` / `ForceFirstPerson()` → can't control VR camera.
- [ ] `Input.GetMappedKey()` → returns -1 for VR controllers. Use VRIK API.
- [ ] `Game.ShakeCamera()` → mostly inert in VR, leave in but document.
- [ ] `SetAngle()` on player → doesn't control HMD orientation.

## Step 3: Skeleton Compatibility

- [ ] Check for custom skeleton nodes → **PreWEAPON and PreSHIELD nodes cause CTD in VR**
- [ ] Verify XP32 compatibility → need "XP32 First Person Skeleton CTD Bugfix" for VR
- [ ] Any `.hkx` behavior files → Havok behaviors work but test with VRIK IK overlay

## Step 4: Physics and Combat

- [ ] Havok physics tuned for 60Hz? → VR runs at 90Hz, needs `fMaxTime` INI adjustment
- [ ] Player collision assumptions → VR uses capsule vs ragdoll (not capsule vs capsule)
- [ ] Melee hit detection → Precision doesn't exist for VR; HIGGS/VRIK handle this
- [ ] Weapon reach values → formula changes without Precision

## Step 5: UI and Menus

- [ ] SkyUI dependency → needs SkyUI VR fork specifically
- [ ] Custom menus/widgets → VR UI is completely reworked for controllers
- [ ] MCM menus → must use SkyUI VR MCM
- [ ] Book content → treated as 2D HUD layer in VR

## Step 6: Animation System

- [ ] OAR/DAR animations → OAR has native VR support; DAR needs VR fix or OAR conversion
- [ ] Animation Motion Revolution → VR-compatible (CTD was fixed in update)
- [ ] SCAR → dedicated VR port exists (BFCO)
- [ ] Animation priorities → must be higher than MCO/ADXP for proper playback

## Step 7: ESP Record Check

Serialize with Spriggit and check:
- [ ] Casting type consistency on all spells (all effects must match)
- [ ] ONAM subrecords if ESM-flagged
- [ ] ESL FormID range (xx000800-xx000FFF)
- [ ] VMAD script properties → prefer `GetFormFromFile()` to minimize properties

## Step 8: Create VR Patch

Based on findings:
1. Create a VR compatibility patch ESP if record changes are needed
2. Rewrite incompatible Papyrus scripts
3. Document what was changed and why
4. Test in VR with VRIK, HIGGS, and OpenComposite active

## Output

Provide a clear report:
- **Compatible as-is**: items that work without changes
- **Needs patching**: items that need script rewrites or ESP patches
- **Incompatible**: items that fundamentally can't work in VR (and workarounds if any)
- **Recommended testing**: specific in-game scenarios to verify
