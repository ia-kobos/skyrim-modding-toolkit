#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Wrapper for skyrim-winner.js that turns its output into a trustworthy exit code.
#
# Why this exists: every koffi/xelib Node helper here exits non-zero (often 127,
# sometimes with a stray "Failed to sync '<stdout>': Incorrect function") under
# Git Bash even on complete success -- node's stdio flush fails during shutdown
# while XEditLib.dll is still resident. It is not reachable from JS. So the
# script prints a RESULT: line and this wrapper judges THAT, never $?.
# See the skyrim-winner notes in AGENTS.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/skyrim-winner.sh winner    <formid> [plugin]
#   bash tools/skyrim-winner.sh chain     <formid> [plugin]
#   bash tools/skyrim-winner.sh conflicts <plugin>
